## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
```javascript
{
  "react": "18.2.0",                    // Core framework
  "react-router-dom": "6.22.3",        // Client-side routing
  "tailwindcss": "3.4.17",             // Utility-first CSS
  "recharts": "2.15.3",                // Professional charts
  "react-icons": "5.5.0",              // Feather icon set
  "@headlessui/react": "2.2.4",        // Accessible UI components
  "firebase": "10.14.1"                // Backend services
}
```

### Application Structure
